What medicinal herbs did the ancient Khmers cook with?

**By Microsoft CoPilot**

üåø Khmer Royal Cuisine is rich in flavors and history. Let's dive into the essentials:

## Medicinal Herbs and Vegetables:
- **Noni leaves (Morinda citrifolia):** These leaves are considered medicinal and are occasionally added to Cambodian curries. The noni fruit itself has antibacterial properties.
- **Moringa leaves (Moringa oleifera):** Essential for "samlor korkor," Cambodia's popular soup. Moringa leaves taste similar to arugula and are slightly bitter.
- **Curry leaves (Murraya koenigii):** Used in soups and curries, especially chicken or duck soup, with a rich, earthy broth unique to Southeast Asia.
- **River leaf creeper (Aganonerion polymorphum):** Known as "la giang," this sour herb is used in curries and pairs well with fresh baguette.
- **Kaffir lime leaves (Citrus hystrix):** Indispensable in Cambodian cooking, adding a powerful citrus flavor to dishes.
- **Lemongrass (Cymbopogon):** Critical for flavor profiles, just like kaffir lime leaves¬π.

## Soups:
- **Samlor:** Cambodian soups are called "samlor." They're diverse, made with whatever ingredients are available. Some popular ones include:
    - **Beef Soup:** Aromatic broth with lemongrass, galangal, kaffir lime leaves, tender beef, rice noodles, and fresh herbs.
    - **Watermelon Rind Soup (Samlor Samach):** A regal creation passed down from Cambodian royalty, combining unique flavors‚Å∏¬π¬≥.
    - **Other Samlor Varieties:** There are many more samlor recipes, each with its own distinct ingredients and flavors¬π¬π.

## Longevity and Beautifying Teas:
- While specific teas associated with Khmer Royal Cuisine aren't widely documented, the French protectorate specified high-quality coffee and tea for the palace. You can explore herbal teas using traditional Cambodian herbs and spices for their potential health benefits¬≤.

3. **Golden Stuffed Chicken:** A regal dish where chicken is stuffed with fragrant herbs and spices, then roasted to perfection.
4. **Salted Crab Salad:** A zesty salad made with salted crab, fresh herbs, and lime juice.
